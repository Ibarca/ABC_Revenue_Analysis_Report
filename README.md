# 📦 Data Analytics with SQL Portfolio (with Synthetic E-Commerce Data)

This repository showcases a collection of **data analysis projects inspired by real-world e-commerce challenges** that I led or contributed to professionally.  
To respect confidentiality and GDPR requirements, **all data used in these projects is fully synthetic**, but the **logic, methods, and business reasoning reflect real scenarios** from my work in category management, private-label management, and commercial analytics.

The goal of this portfolio is to demonstrate:

- My ability to work with **Python, pandas, SQL, Power BI, and Looker Studio**
- My strength in building **data pipelines, cleaning datasets, and creating actionable insights**
- My understanding of **e-commerce operations**, including pricing, inventory, forecasting, profitability analysis, and customer behaviour
- My analytical thinking and business decision-making skills
